## Hi there 👋

My name is Tanmay, and I'm a GTech 🐝 physicist exploring the space of Data Science, Machine Learning and Silicon Photonics

## 🔬 Projects at the Intersection of Physics & ML

### 🧠 Scientific ML
- [`SciML`](https://github.com/lemontang3/SciML) — Core scientific machine learning methods for PDEs and uncertainty quantification.
- [`data-assimilation`](https://github.com/lemontang3/data-assimilation) — Bayesian inference using ensemble score filters.

### 🚌 Simulation & RL
- [`Bus_Bunching_CS6242`](https://github.com/lemontang3/Bus_Bunching_CS6242) — Reinforcement Learning to mitigate bus bunching using Q-Learning.

### ⚛️ Physics Notebooks
- [`Python_Physics`](https://github.com/lemontang3/Python_Physics) — Interactive Jupyter Notebooks explaining core physics problems with visualizations.

### 📉 ML in Finance
- [`QML_Fin`](https://github.com/lemontang3/QML_Fin) — Quantitative trading strategies with LSTMs and Bayesian models.
